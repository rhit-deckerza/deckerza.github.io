            <p>
              Last year I found myself constantly disappointed by the workout tracking applications on the market, so I decided to create my own with the help of a couple friends.
              Together we created a list of requirements, a mock through Figma, decided our stack, brushed up on web design, learned the framework "React", and began to execute our plans.
              So far we have finished the homepage and log workout page as well as all of the backend and plan to have a workout archive page by the end of the month.

              At the end of my Freshman year I was asked to join a research group with four other students
              and Professor of Computer Science Dr. Jason Yoder. Together we developed an evolutionary algorithm in Java that developes strategies for traversing NK landscapes.
              We submitted our paper to the ALIFE conference in the winter of 2021/22 where it was accepted and published.
              You can read the published paper by clicking on the title.

              As a final project for my software quality assurance course three other students and I created the board game "Settlers of Catan" in Java.
              The final program has nearly all features of the board game and is fully playable on a desktop device.
              All members followed test driven design for the project resulting in 100% basis path coverage.

              As a final project for my databases course two other team members and I created a web application that allows users to create "builds" for the
              popular game Elden Ring. Together we created a front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also created a back end using Python and Microsoft SQL.
              Using the application users can create accounts and login, create builds, view their builds, and make a number of changes to their builds.

              As a final project for my web design course, another student and I created a web application where
              a Rose-Hulman student can create a four to five year course plan for completing their double major.
              At Rose-Hulman, a student must layout their course plan on excel sheet to be able to apply for a double major which can be very tedious.
              We created this website with the intention of making it easier for students to apply for a double major.

            <p>
              As a final project for my computer architecture course, three other students and I created a simulated general purpose stack processor in Xilinx.
              The processor takes 16-bit instructions with 17 different opcodes to execute different operations. Our final processor is able to execute
              euclids algorithm as well as most common operations. It is a multi-cycle processor with three to four stages for each instruction, greatly increasing its efficiency.
              I also created an assembler for this processor turning our assembly code into machine language. The Github repository for this project as well as our final report can be found by clicking the tile. (Coming soon)

              As a final project for my data structures and algorithms class another student and I created a modified AVL tree
              data structure intended to be efficient for a word editor. On top of its self-balancing nature, we also implemented a "rank" system
              that would allow the program to find a nodes position in the string the tree represents. This allowed for insertion and deletion at any position in O(log(n)) time.

              As a final project for my object oriented design class another student and I decided to make a simple evolutionary algorithm.
              Our program allows you to modify factors such as mutation rate, population size, generation count, and many more. Our algorithm also has support for multiple
              types of selection like truncation or roulette wheel. You are also able to the diversity and average fitness throughout the evolutionary cycles as well as the chromosome of the agent with the best fitness.
