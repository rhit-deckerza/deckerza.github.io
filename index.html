            My name is Zachary Decker and I am Junior at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology double majoring in computer science and software engineering.
            I am a hardworking and passionate student who is looking for opportunities push myself and create value with my skills.

            I grew up in Newport Beach, California where I attended Sage Hill Highschool.
            After highschool I made a leap of faith decision to move across the country and study engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute.
            Coming in I had no idea what I wanted to major in, I eventually decided to pursue a comupter science major as I did some programming in highschool. 
            After my first few courses, I had already fell in love. The ease and speed with which you could create complex solutions to problems through computer programming amazed me. 
            A particular experience that really started my passion for computer science was a simple genetic algorithm project I completed at the end of my freshman year. 
            It was by far the largest and most complex project I had completed up to that point so expectedly it was quite a challenge. After many late nights and what felt like non-stop programing, my partner and I completed the project.
            It was then that I was sure I made the right choice with computer science. Despite the long hours, I was consistently excited to work on the project. 
            On top of this, I had made something I was proud of which made me realize my potential for creating great things through computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the time since I have continued to pursue my passion, learning many skills even outside of the required material. Through the countless group projects as well as
            the research project I worked on for a year, I have also learned a lot about how to work in a team and how to communicate effectively.
