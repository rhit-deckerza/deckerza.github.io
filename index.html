            After highschool I made the decision to study at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with no idea what I wanted to pursue.
            Luckily, I decided to try a comupter science major as I did some programming in highschool. Immediatly I was very passionate about the field always spending 
            my time learning as much as I could in my classes. I really fell in love during a project at the end of my Freshman year where I spend countless hours with a 
            partner creating a simple genetic algorithm. Despite the many late nights, I loved solving problems and learning new things while working on the project and I realized computer science is what I want to do as a living.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the time since I have continued to pursue my passion, learning many skills even outside of computer science. Through the countless group projects as well as
            the researh project I worked on for a year, I have learned a lot about how to work in a team and how to communicate effectively.
